    <h3>Bistecca alla Fiorentina (Florentine-style beefsteak)</h3>
     
    <p><strong>The "Crown Jewel" of Tuscan cuisine, this is a massive, thick-cut porterhouse steak typically sourced from the ancient Chianina breed of cattle.</strong></p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><b>The Cut</b>: An authentic Fiorentina must be at least 1.5 to 2 inches thick and usually weighs between 2 and 3 pounds, intended for sharing. It includes both the tenderloin (filet) and the strip loin, joined by the characteristic T-shaped bone.</li>
        <li><b>The Fire</b>: The steak is grilled over extremely high heat—traditionally over oak or chestnut wood coals—to create a charred, salty crust while keeping the interior strictly rare (al sangue).</li>
        <li><b>The Minimalists Finish</b>: In true Tuscan style, the meat is never marinated. It is seasoned only with coarse sea salt, cracked black pepper, and a generous drizzle of high-quality, pungent extra-virgin olive oil after it has rested.</li>
    </ul>
