    <h3>The Oklahoma Onion Smash Burger</h3>
    <h3>A product of the Depression era, this burger is a study in "flavor through compression." It is defined by its intense caramelization and the way the meat and onions become a single, inseparable entity.</h3>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>The Smash Technique</b>: A ball of high-fat ground beef (80/20) is placed on a ripping-hot griddle and immediately topped with a handful of <b>paper-thin shaved onions</b>. A heavy press is used to "smash" the beef into the onions, forcing the onion juices into the meat while the edges of the beef become lacy and shatteringly crisp.</li>
        <li><b>The Steam</b>: As the meat sears, the moisture from the onions steams the top of the patty. The bun is placed directly over the onions as they cook, absorbing the savory vapors and becoming soft and pillow-like.</li>
        <li><b>The Minimalist Build</b>: Traditionally, this burger requires nothing more than <b>American cheese</b>, which melts into the crevices of the onions, and perhaps a few dill pickles to provide a sharp, vinegary crunch against the sweet, charred onions.</li>
    </ul>
