    <h3>Classic Lasagna with Bolognese Sauce</h3>

    <p><strong>Lasagna alla Bolognese is a refined Italian masterpiece from the Emilia-Romagna region, celebrated for its "elegant simplicity" and melt-in-the-mouth texture.
         Unlike American-style versions that rely on heavy ricotta, this authentic dish is defined by its delicate layers of thin pasta, slow-cooked meat ragù, and silky béchamel sauce.</strong></p>
        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
         <ol>
            <li><strong>Ragu alla Bolognese (Meat Sauce)</strong></li>
                <p><em>A traditional ragù focuses on a deep, savory meat flavor rather than a heavy tomato base.</em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>The Meats</b>: 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground pork (or a mix of beef, pork, and veal). Finely diced pancetta (about 2–4 oz) is often added for extra depth.</li>
                    <li><b>Aromatics (Fragrant Vegetables)</b>: 1 medium onion, 1–2 carrots, and 1–2 celery stalks, all very finely minced.</li>
                    <li><b>Liquids</b>: 1 cup dry red or white wine (for deglazing) and 1–2 cups whole milk (to tenderize the meat).</li>
                    <li><b>Tomatoes</b>: 1 can (28 oz) of crushed tomatoes or whole peeled tomatoes (crushed by hand) and 2–3 tbsp tomato paste.</li>
                    <li><b>Seasonings</b>: Fresh bay leaves, salt, and freshly cracked black pepper. Some chefs add a pinch of clove or cinnamon.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Bechamel Sauce(Besciamella)</strong></li>
                <p><em>This creamy white sauce replaces the ricotta found in American-style lasagna.</em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Roux Base</b>: 4–5 tbsp unsalted butter and 1/4 to 1/3 cup all-purpose flour.</li>
                    <li><b>Liquid</b>: 3–4 cups whole milk, preferably warmed before adding to the roux.</li>
                    <li><b>Flavoring</b>: A generous pinch of freshly grated nutmeg, salt, and white or black pepper.</li>                
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Pasta and Cheese</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Lasagna Sheets</b>: 1 lb of fresh egg pasta sheets (plain or spinach) or 12–15 high-quality "no-boil" or dried lasagna noodles.</li>
                    <li><b>Parmigiano-Reggiano</b>: While not strictly traditional for Bolognese, many 2026 recipes include 1 lb of fresh mozzarella (diced or sliced) for additional meltiness.</li>
                    <li><b>Mozzarella (Optional)</b>: While not strictly traditional for Bolognese, many 2026 recipes include 1 lb of fresh mozzarella (diced or sliced) for additional meltiness.</li>                
                </ul>
        </ol>
