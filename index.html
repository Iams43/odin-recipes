    <h3>Classic Lasagna with Bolognese Sauce</h3>

    <p><strong>Lasagna alla Bolognese is a refined Italian masterpiece from the Emilia-Romagna region, celebrated for its "elegant simplicity" and melt-in-the-mouth texture.
         Unlike American-style versions that rely on heavy ricotta, this authentic dish is defined by its delicate layers of thin pasta, slow-cooked meat ragù, and silky béchamel sauce.</strong></p>
        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
         <ol>
            <li><strong>Ragu alla Bolognese (Meat Sauce)</strong></li>
                <p>A traditional ragù focuses on a deep, savory meat flavor rather than a heavy tomato base.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>The Meats</b>: 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground pork (or a mix of beef, pork, and veal). Finely diced pancetta (about 2–4 oz) is often added for extra depth.</li>
                    <li><b>Aromatics (Fragrant Vegetables)</b>: 1 medium onion, 1–2 carrots, and 1–2 celery stalks, all very finely minced.</li>
                    <li><b>Liquids</b>: 1 cup dry red or white wine (for deglazing) and 1–2 cups whole milk (to tenderize the meat).</li>
                    <li><b>Tomatoes</b>: 1 can (28 oz) of crushed tomatoes or whole peeled tomatoes (crushed by hand) and 2–3 tbsp tomato paste.</li>
                    <li><b>Seasonings</b>: Fresh bay leaves, salt, and freshly cracked black pepper. Some chefs add a pinch of clove or cinnamon.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Bechamel Sauce(Besciamella)</li>
            <li>Pasta and Cheese</li>
        </ol>
